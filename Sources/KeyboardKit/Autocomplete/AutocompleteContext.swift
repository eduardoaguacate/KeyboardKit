/**
 This observable class can be used to handle an autocomplete
 specific state, including configurations and suggestions.
 
 The ``isAutocompleteEnabled`` property can be set to `false`
 to completely disable autocomplete. The property is used by
 both the ``KeyboardInputViewController`` as well as service
 implementations, to not perform autocomplete.
 
 The ``isAutocorrectEnabled`` property can be set to `false`,
 to disable autocorrection. This property can be used by any
 autocomplete service implementation, to remove autocorrects
 from the result.

 KeyboardKit automatically creates an instance of this class
 and binds it to ``KeyboardInputViewController/state``.
